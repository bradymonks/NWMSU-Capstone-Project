# NWMSU-Capstone-Project

Walk through the AthleteDatabase.csv file with me as I perform analysis on it and look for distinct patterns.

## Overview

Using python analysis, I wanted to find where athletes are being produced among the three major sporting leagues in the United States - Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, and National Football League. Performing EDA on the data and introducing a new metric, I was able to get quality results over an abundance of data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I started with the EDA.ipynb script as wanted to get a general idea of the data I was using. I was able to put together some insightful visuals that allowed an idea of the data set to be formed.

# This repo will maintain the code and CSV file that I will be using.
